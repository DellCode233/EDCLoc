# EDCLoc: A Prediction Model for mRNA Subcellular Localization Using Improved Focal Loss to Address Multi-Label Class Imbalance
EDCLoc is a novel multi-label classifier designed to predict the subcellular localization of mRNA, a critical factor in regulating gene expression and cellular function. Traditional experimental methods for mRNA localization are time-consuming and costly, and existing prediction tools face limitations in handling sequence length variations and high-dimensional data. EDCLoc addresses these challenges with a more efficient and accurate approach.
